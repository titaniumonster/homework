### 1. NFC (Near-field communication)
*"Near-field communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices, one of which is usually a portable device such as a smartphone, to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm (1.6 in) of each other."* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication)
NFC are often used in contactless payments, social networking, and also can act as electronic identity documents and keycards. It made our life easier and more efficient.

### 2. iPad & Apple Pencil
*"iPad is a line of tablet computers designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc., which run the iOS mobile operating system."*(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad)
*"The Apple Pencil is a digital stylus pen that works as an input device for the iPad Pro and the 2018 iPad, both tablet computers."*(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil)
iPad series are gradually designed for creative works instead portable when smartphones are pretty much enough.

### 3. Qi
*"is an open interface standard that defines wireless power transfer using inductive charging over distances of up to 4 cm (1.6 inches), and is developed by the Wireless Power Consortium. The system uses a charging pad and a compatible device, which is placed on top of the pad, charging via resonant inductive coupling."* （https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi(standard) ）
Qi is a developing technology and it's getting more and more widely used in our daily life.

### 4. 3D Touch/Force Touch
*“Force Touch is a technology developed by Apple Inc. that enables trackpads and touchscreens to distinguish between various levels of force being applied to their surfaces”* （https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Touch#3D_Touch）
This touch technology gives more possibilities for the interactions between the system, screeen, and the user.

### 5. iCloud
*"iCloud is a cloud storage and cloud computing service from Apple Inc. The service provides its users with means to store data such as documents, photos, and music on remote servers for download to iOS, macOS or Windows devices, to share and send data to other users, and to manage their Apple devices if lost or stolen.""* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud) 
With iCloud and other wireless online(cloud) storage services, we get the chance to save and store our data and share them in a much more easier way rather than plug into a hard-drive.
