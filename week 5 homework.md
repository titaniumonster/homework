# In your own words explain what the Internet is and how it came to be. Give both a technical explination (that a regular person would understand) as well as historical context.

The Internet is a global system which allows computer networks all over the world connected with each other. It is the infrastructure of carrying email, instant messaging, Voiceover IP, network games, file transfer and the Web.

According to Vinton Cerf, the inventor of the Internet, "Internet was born in Belgium". By his meaning, there was a Belgian bibliophile described his vision for télé photographie is to display the documents from anywhere of the world on a television screen. Paul Otlet was a Belgian as well. In 1891, he cooperated with Henri La Fontaine, and reach out to Mundaneum, a collection that collects published knowledge. With those digital collections, Otlet named them "Réseau", which is a network of documents that are connected by "links" based on the index card. The "links" is now we called "Semantic Web".

The birth of the Internet is actually one of the side-effect of US' scientific research after Soviet Union launched first manmade satellite, *Sputnik*. Following WW2, US formed RAND Corporation, which contributed the production of radar and atomic bomb. Their first project was artificial satellite, which Soviet Union has lead ahead a lot. US felt they were being humiliated and they eventually sent a man on the moon. The Advanced Research Projects Agency(ARPA) is the key of sent man on the moon. Bob Taylor is the successor of ARPA's first leader Joseph Licklider, who wants not only sent human on the moon, but also create Intergulactic Computer Network. Bob Taylor was funding 3 computer projects at the same time, air-defence system, computing time-sharing system and a operating system. He found that the things that these three projects were doing are pretty much the same, so combine them seems logical. In another hand, at RAND, Paul Baran was tasked to design a system that could survived from nuclear attack. He also proposed a way to transfer messages, break the message into blocks, and pass them via multiple paths, then reconstruct the message at the arrival. Around the same time, Donald Davies in UK got the same idea and call it "packet switching". Later the ideas from RAND and ARPA came together and creates the Internet. 

At 29th October, 1969, the first message was sent in ARPANET with BBN Technologies. It successfully connected few universities though it soon crushed. Few months later, other universities joined in and formed ARPANET. This is the first step to Intergulactic Computer Network, which now we called the Internet.
