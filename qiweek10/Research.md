 I put some acrylic pigments directly on the canvas and made them looks rugged in order to echo the text on the bottom which says "put them anywhere". This piece is basiclly a promote for the future Qi standard wireless charing. In this future, the biggest point is it can be charged anywhere, even on the rugged surface.
